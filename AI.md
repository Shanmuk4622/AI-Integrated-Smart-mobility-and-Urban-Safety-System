# 🤖 AI Assistance Disclosure

## 1. Purpose
This document serves as a transparent declaration regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in the development of the **AI-Integrated Smart Mobility & Urban Safety System**. It is intended to uphold academic integrity, demonstrate engineering accountability, and outline the boundaries of human vs. AI contribution.

---

## 2. AI Tools Utilized
The following AI assistants were leveraged to accelerate development and optimization:

*   **Google Gemini / OpenAI ChatGPT**: Used for high-level architectural planning, debugging complex logic errors, and generating documentation drafts.
*   **GitHub Copilot**: Used for code autocompletion, boilerplate generation, and rapid refactoring detailed functions.

---

## 3. Scope of AI Assistance

### ✅ AI Was Used For:
*   **Boilerplate Code**: Generating initial directory structures and standard configuration files (e.g., `vite.config.ts`, `requirements.txt`).
*   **Logic Templates**: Drafting the initial structure for React components (Dashboard widgets) and Python scripts (Video processing loops).
*   **Debugging**: Analyzing stack traces to identify syntax errors or library version conflicts.
*   **Documentation**: converting technical notes into structured Markdown files (e.g., `README.md`, `AI.md`).

### ❌ AI Was NOT Used For:
*   **Core System Design**: The decision to use a Hybrid Edge-Cloud architecture (Worker + Supabase) was a human engineering decision.
*   **Algorithm Selection**: The specific choice of **YOLOv8** for detection and **SORT** for tracking was made based on human research into edge-device performance constraints.
*   **Critical Logic**: The "Traffic Rule" algorithms (e.g., green signal duration limits, ambulance priority logic) were manually tuned and verified.
*   **Final Verification**: All AI-suggested code was manually reviewed, tested, and modified to ensure it meets the specific project requirements.

## 4. Component Breakdown

| Component | AI Contribution | Human Contribution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend (React)** | Scaffolding UI layouts, CSS styling suggestions. | State management logic, real-time subscription handling, final UI/UX polish. |
| **Worker (Python)** | Syntax for OpenCV functions, error handling structures. | **Wrong-Way Detection Algorithm**, **Speed Estimation Math**, Integration of YOLO+SORT. |
| **Database (SQL)** | Generating basic table schemas (`CREATE TABLE`). | Designing **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies, optimization of indexes, architecture of relations. |
| **Docs** | Formatting and structure. | Content accuracy, architectural diagrams, and feature descriptions. |

---

## 5. Verification Process
To ensure reliability, the following verification steps were taken for all AI-generated content:
1.  **Code Review**: Every line of code generated by AI was reviewed for security vulnerabilities (e.g., exposing API keys) and logic flaws.
2.  **Functional Testing**: Automated and manual tests were run to verify that the code behaves as expected in real-world scenarios (e.g., testing the "Route Planner" with actual GPS coordinates).
3.  **Refactoring**: AI suggestions were often refactored to modularize code (moving logic to `services/` or `core/`) to maintain a clean codebase.

## 6. Responsibility Statement
While AI tools were used to enhance productivity, the **Author** takes full and sole responsibility for:
*   The final system architecture and design choices.
*   The correctness and reliability of the code.
*   The ethical considerations of the system (privacy, safety).
*   All data handling and security implementations.
